        <h2>My motivation</h2><br>
        <h3>Theory</h3><br>
        <p>According to the Oxford Dictionary, motivation means: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>a reason or reasons to act or behave in a particular way.</li>
            <li>desire or willingness to do something.</li>
        </ul><br>
        The word originates from two words, these being "motive" and "motivate", being merged together. <br>
        A motive is a reason to do something, and to motivate someone means you encourage them to do something. <br>
        Thus, we can conclude that "motivation" means you have your reasoning and your desire to get something done. <br><br>
      
        Beata Souders, a psychology practitioner, claims the simplest definition of motivation boils down to wanting. <br>
        People want to change something, whether it's about themselves or something in their environment. <br><br>
        
        There are various types of motivation, including: 
        <ol>
            <li>Achievement motivation. Achievement motivation is a pretty straight-forward term. 
                It means one is motivated to work hard to reach a certain goal. 
                One keeps this kind of motivation so they can continuously climb the ladder of success. </li> <br>
            
            <li>Affiliative motivation. 
                Affiliative motivation means someone is motivated to accomplish something, because of their reputation.
                For example, artists work hard because people like their art, and musicians work hard because people like their music. </li> <br>
           
            <li>Competent motivation.
                This kind of motivation is pretty similar to the first type of motivation mentioned.
                Competent motivation means someone wants to be good at something, so they can perform high-quality work.
                People who feel competently motivated will strive to get better and learn from their experiences.</li> <br>

            <li>Power motivation.
                Power motivation can be considered a pretty bad quality sometimes.
                Someone who is power-motivated will work hard so they can influence things or people.
                They are pretty often highly confident and feel very responsible,
                however they will value their need for power outweighs their care for a social status.</li> <br>

            <li>Incentive motivation.
                When someone's main motivation is the reward they get for finishing their work, we are talking about incentive motivation.
                However, people with this kind of motivation also avoid actions that would get them in trouble.
                Incentive motivation is quite common, people will work harder if it means they get paid more.</li> <br>
                
            <li>Fear motivation.
                Fear motivation means someone is motivated because they will overcome a certain fear. 
                Essentially, people with this motivation will take a step out of their comfort zone, for the sake of improvement.
                For example, someone with anxiety starts going out more.
            </li> 
        </ol><br><br>
        Dan Pink says in his Ted Talk: <br>
        "If you want people to perform better, you reward them, right? Bonuses, commissions, their own reality show. That's how business works." <br>
        However, followed by this, he says it can pretty often have the opposite effect as well, as it can dull thinking and creativity. <br>
        When something requires less creativity, and the goal is right in front of you, incentive motivation works very often.

    <h3>Performance Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        <!-- note! i did not copy and paste the results here, as i took the dutch test -->
        According to the performance motivation test I took, my motivation, both intrinsic and extrinsic, is pretty moderate. <br>
        I do enjoy studying, but it's not my favourite thing in the world to do. <br>
        Of course, I also keep in mind that with this study, I can do a lot of things when I'm older, which I know I'm going to enjoy as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Career anchors/values</h3>
    <p>
        Most important anchors:
        <ul>
            <li>Independency/autonomy. I earned 21/100 points for this. <br> I wish to be more independent in my career, so I can work at my own pace and live up to my own expectations. </li> <br>
            <li>Expertise(Being good at something). I earned 18/100 points for this. <br> I hope I can be good at what I plan to do in the future, so I have to be less dependent on others and am able to do more myself.</li>
        </ul> <br> <br>
        I scored the least amount of points for norms and values (6/100). <br>
        I think I scored pretty low here because I don't feel very confident about things I do,
        and in case I ever make a mistake, I don't want that to affect others.
    </p>
        

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Personally, I think I am fairly motivated for this study. <br>
        I do wish I could work harder, as I feel very exhausted sometimes, but I do enjoy the study so far. <br>
        I hope I can still learn more about ICT.

<h2>Welcome to my Website Project!</h2>
<p class="welcome">On this website I will talk about:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Why I chose for HBO ICT</li>
    <li>Who I am</li>
</ul>
<br>
I will also show:
<ul> 
    <li>A study monitor</li>
    <li>A study guide</li>
</ul>
I will also answer some frequently asked questions about the school.

<h3>Why am I here?</h3>
<p class="whyamihere">
    The HBO level suits me because I have experience with higher-level education.<br>
    Before I came here, I took a HAVO level science-oriented course.<br><br><br>

    The study programme suits my personality because I've always been a fan of ICT.<br>
    I think it's interesting how one can make several things appear on a screen, just by simply typing things into a program. <br>
    Also, something like game development is something I really want to get into in the future.<br>
    I hope I will be able to make games that are as good as the games I play myself nowadays.

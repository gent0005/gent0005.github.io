        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Merijn van Gent. <br>
            I am 17 years old and I live in Terneuzen, Netherlands.<br>
            Hobbies of mine are playing games, listening to music and going outside with friends.<br>
            Some games I like are survival games, like Minecraft and Subnautica, but also shooters like DOOM and rhythm games like Stepmania.<br><br>
            Before going to the HZ, I went to the Lodewijk College in Terneuzen.<br>
            There, I went to the HAVO. <br><br>

            <br>
            While I think I can be pretty introverted usually, I can be social as well.<br>
            I like to keep things simple if possible, but I try my best to get things done. <br><br>

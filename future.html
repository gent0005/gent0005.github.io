        <h2>My Future</h2>
        <p>A direction I'd personally really like to take in this course later on is Software Engineering. <br>
        I want to be able to create my own programs and games, or create modification pack for existing games. <br>
        Even just being able to create something as simple as a small program like a Discord bot with customized commands seems really interesting to me,
        and it's really something I'd like to know more about. <br><br>
        I'm still not very certain about what I <i>exactly</i> want to be later, but anything software engineering-related speaks to me. <br><br>
        In order to get to know more about this course, I want to take part in several activities. <br>
        For example, there are a few national museums on the ITP list, like the Computer Museum in Amsterdam, the Console Museum in Zwolle,
        and the Apple Museum in Westerbork, which I believe could be really interesting.</p>
